## Synopsis

At the top of the file there should be a short introduction and/ or overview that explains **what** the project is. This description should match descriptions added for package managers (Gemspec, package.json, etc.)

## Code Example

Basic ES6 transpiler with a dest directory, webpack dev server, and linting.

## Motivation

Wanted to have a seed ES6 project.  Future implementations would include gulp tasks that leverage this seed.

`npm install`

## Use

`npm run dev`

all development files are located in src directory and transpiled to dest directory
